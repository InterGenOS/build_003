#**The InterGenOS Project**
---


###After their initial look at the project, followed by their 'Oh, cool!', and 'Sweet!' comments, everyone keeps asking me-
                                                      

"Why make your own distro, though?  That seems like too much work. Why don't you just use **(insert distro title here)** and
then just add **(insert package name here)**?"


*To me the answer is pretty simple:*


"There isn't a single distro that does exactly what I want it to right out of the box."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Defining "what I want a distro to do right out of the box" ties directly to the primary goal of the project, and gives
any observer a glimpse at the scope involved:

The InterGenOS Goal:

     To develop a Linux Distribution that incorporates all current (as of 2015) major Linux Desktop Environments into  
     its core installation, simplifies seemingly odd file and package installation locations, and maintainins an       
     'Arch Linux'-like "ease of use" along with excellent package management.

Some more of the basic Q&A's that have come up regarding the project: 
(Makes for an entertaining read at some points)


###Q. Isn't this a pretty big, wide-reaching goal?

A. Absolutely.


###Q. Is someone paying for this project?

A. Not at all.


###Q. So if you're not getting paid, why are you doing this?

A. Lot's of reasons:



  **1. Low cost**  Monetarily it costs me nothing, but I do lose some of my free time (or my wife's free time- depending on 
    who you're asking)
  

  **2. Learning**  The amount of information I've learned about Linux since the project's inception is staggering
  

  **3. Fun**  Yes, this is fun, enjoyable, and relaxing to me  
  

  **4. Contributing**  I've gotten alot of enjoyment out of the free software I've used until this point- I'd like to work 
    towards giving something back



###Q. You're seriously not making a dime off this?

A. Unless RedHat decides to hire me, then nope, not a **penny**


###Q. Are you retarded?

A. Maybe. But I bet this *retard* knows alot more about **Linux** than you do.  **:)**


###Q. Is anyone helping you with the project?

A. Yes, but we always welcome new help


###Q. How are you building this OS?

A. I started using the LFS Project to build the initial systems I used as a proof of concept (to myself, really).
   Now that we know building a working Linux System from source isn't an 'Unnaturally God-like mythical
   creation process', it's been alot of fun to start planning how we want to develop a new distribution.


###Q. Will it be done soon?

A. Probably not.  We're still working out fun stuff- like what files and directories should go where and for what,
   and how that's going to tie into our package management, etc.  Reallistically, you may see something within
   the next 12 to 16 months- unless more people hop on board and help out.


###Q. What package manager are you using?

A. The package manager's name is Linpack (from... Linux Package... seemed simple enough).  It's similar to pacman,
   so anyone who's familiar with Arch will have an easy time adjusting to it.  It's also a bit simpler to use,
   so anyone who's not familiar with Arch will have an easy time adjusting to it, too.  **:)**


*more to come, stay tuned...*
